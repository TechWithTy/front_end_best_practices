# Capability Exploration

Use "What PWA Can Do Today" to validate browser support before adding roadmap items.[^what-pwa]

Key demos:
- Install prompts & add-to-home-screen flows
- Offline caches and background sync
- Declarative Web Push
- App shortcuts, share targets, media capture, sensors (NFC, Bluetooth, Orientation, Motion)
- File system, file handling, payments, wake lock, speech, and more

Workflow:
1. Check the demo list to confirm API support on target devices.
2. Prototype in an isolated sandbox before integrating into Deal Scale.
3. Update `roadmap.md` with findings and the required browser versions.
