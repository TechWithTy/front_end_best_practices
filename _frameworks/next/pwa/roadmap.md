# Roadmap Ideas

Evaluate these enhancements as platform APIs evolve:

- **Declarative Web Push** — Reduce service worker complexity once browser support stabilizes.[^what-pwa]
- **Badging & Shortcuts** — Surface lead alerts or campaign tasks via manifest `shortcuts` and the Badging API.
- **File Handling / Launch Handlers** — Deep link CSV imports or campaign templates directly into the app.
- **Window Controls Overlay** — Deliver a native-feel window on desktop installs.
- **Share Target** — Accept imports via OS share sheets.
- **Periodic Background Sync** — Automate analytics refresh when connectivity is restored.

Keep feasibility notes and browser compatibility matrices here before committing to implementation.
