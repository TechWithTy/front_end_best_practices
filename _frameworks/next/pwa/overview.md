# PWA Overview

Deal Scale treats the dashboard as an installable, offline-friendly experience that mirrors native expectations:

- **App-like access:** Users can install the site and launch it from their OS with dedicated icons and shortcuts.
- **Resilient networking:** Service workers cache core assets and analytics, while background sync protects queued actions during outages.
- **Timely updates:** Push notifications, install prompts, and update toasts keep operators informed without requiring the browser chrome.

These goals drive every entry in this folder. Review the other documents for implementation and testing details.
