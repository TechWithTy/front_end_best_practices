# Feature Test Harness Plan

Each PWA capability should have a companion Vitest + React Testing Library spec to exercise end-to-end logic via mocks. Use the files in this folder to describe the scenario, required mocks, and sample assertions.

Template sections:
1. **Scenario** – What user story are we validating?
2. **Setup** – Components/hooks under test and required environment mocks.
3. **Assertions** – Expected behaviour / side effects.
4. **Follow-ups** – Manual or Playwright tests.

Add one file per feature (mirroring parent filenames).
