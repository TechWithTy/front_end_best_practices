# Face Detection

## Capability
Detect faces in images/videos for AI analytics or compliance features using the Shape Detection API.

## Implementation
1. Feature-detect `FaceDetector` (Chromium-only, experimental).
2. Use on uploaded media or live camera feed to highlight detected faces.
3. Respect privacy: run entirely on-device and avoid storing facial data without consent.
4. Provide fallbacks using third-party services or disable feature when unsupported.
