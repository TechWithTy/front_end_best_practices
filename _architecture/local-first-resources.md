## Summary
The Local First Software “Learn” directory curates articles and talks that explain how to build applications that prioritise offline-first behaviour, conflict resolution, and data ownership. Highlights include the Ink & Switch manifesto “Local-first software: you own your data, in spite of the cloud,” CRDT primers, database design notes, and guides on end-to-end encryption.

## Key Topics
- **Local-first manifesto** – Philosophical foundation for storing data on client devices with optional cloud sync.
- **Reactive relational databases** – Techniques for syncing data-centric apps without centralised bottlenecks.
- **CRDT design** – Articles and benchmarks explaining Conflict-free Replicated Data Types for collaboration.
- **End-to-end encryption** – Considerations when data never leaves the client unencrypted.
- **Developer community** – Discord invite, software directory, and ongoing blog posts about tooling.

## Notes for Deal Scale
- Use the manifesto and CRDT resources when evaluating deeper offline capabilities beyond our current service-worker caching approach.
- The directory is a good reference for future roadmap items (e.g., collaborative campaign editing or resilient lead notes) should we shift toward local-first architecture.
